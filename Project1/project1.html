    <p><b> The Dominican Republic</b> is a Caribbean nation that shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti to the west.
       It's known for its beaches, resorts and golfing. Its terrain comprises rainforest, savannah and highlands,
        including Pico Duarte, the Caribbean’s tallest mountain. Capital city Santo Domingo has Spanish landmarks like
         the Gothic Catedral Primada de America dating back 5 centuries in its Zona Colonial district.

           hike through the jungle to Farallon Cliff, and explore a cave’s underground chambers; ride 12 ziplines over the
           Caribbean coastline, ending with a dip in the water; travel in a safari truck to Cape San Rafael, a local waterfall,
           a plantation, and a country home; head for exclusive Juanillo Beach, where you'll enjoy open bar privileges and water
           sports; take a nature walk to see Taino pictograms, then swim in a cenote; play at Xenotes Caribe, a series of diving
           platforms, zip lines and water hammocks that dip into the water; or sail up the coast of Cap Cana on a double-decker catamaran,
           with stops at a sand bar and a snorkeling site.<p>

        <p style = "weight: 50%; float:right;"> The most beautiful stretch of beach in the Punta Cana area is undoubtedly Bávaro Beach,
          just north of Punta Cana. The calm Caribbean waters are perfect for swimming or wading, and the water color is a typical Caribbean
          turquoise hue that stretches out well beyond the roped-off swimming area to the protective reef in the distance. Beyond the swimming
          zone is an action packed area of boats and parasailers. If you want to hire a boat, you can simply walk down to the waterfront in Las
          Galeras, where the main road into town dead-ends at the ocean, and someone will be waiting to help you. The boats leave directly from
          the beach here.</p>

            The first commercial street in the New World remains the most popular pedestrian shopping area. Stretching over 10 blocks, this cobblestoned road is lined with restaurants,
            cafés, souvenir shops, and street side art vendors.

            The first paved street in the Americas: Calle Las Damas or the “street of the ladies,” connects directly to the Alcazar de Colón; María de Toledo and her ladies would step
             out of the palace and stroll up and down Calle Las Damas in the evenings.
