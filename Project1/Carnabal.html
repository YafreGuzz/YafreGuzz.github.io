      Every Sunday during the month of February,
      colorful parades take place in every major city and region around the DR–some
      extending through the first week of March. La Vega Carnival is the oldest,
      largest, and most popular of all, followed by Santiago. Other cities hosting
      unique parades include Santo Domingo, Montecristi, Bonao, Puerto Plata, Río San Juan,
      and Barahona. Costumes, masks, and mystical characters are distinct to each area
      and reveal Dominican folkloric traditions and beliefs, as diverse as the country’s population.

      The season usually launches with a vibrant indoor carnival gala show held in
      Santiago and culminates with Independence Day celebrations on February 27.
      The most colorful event of all is the final National Carnival Parade–held the
      first Sunday of March in the capital of Santo Domingo, it brings together
      carnival groups and characters from around the DR for one last, big carnival
      hurrah along the city’s Malecón waterfront boulevard.

      While you can head to any carnival town or city on your own, several tour
      agencies also organize carnival day trips during the month of February,
      particularly to La Vega Carnival.

      Carnival in the Dominican Republic dates back to 1520, during the Spanish
      colonial times. Some researchers say the first carnival events took place
      as a celebration of a visit by Fray Bartolomé de las Casas, when inhabitants
      disguised themselves as Moors and Christians.<br><br>

      Between 1822 and 1844, the tradition of wearing costumes during religious
      festivities almost disappeared during the Haitian occupation. But it returned
      immediately when the country achieved its independence on February 27, 1844.
      Costumes were then no longer associated with religious celebrations,
      and evolved into actual carnivals, celebrated during the three days prior
      to Ash Wednesday. February was then established as the month of carnival
      in the Dominican Republic.

    <p style="background-color: #c66b3d;" class = "pfix">

      To fully enjoy and understand Dominican carnival, familiarize yourself with
      the main characters, and their significance in Dominican folklore.<br><br>

      <b>El Diablo Cojuelo</b> is carnival’s leading character. This “limping devil”
       wears a colorful cloaked suit adorned with small mirrors, rattles, ribbons,
       and cowbells, as a parody of Spanish medieval knights. A mask with large horns
       covers the devil’s face, as he carries a round whip or vejiga–made from a cow’s
       dried and cured inflated bladder–and goes along the parade route surprising
       distracted onlookers with a lash on their buttocks.<br><br>

      <b>Roba La Gallina</b>, or “the hen robber,” is a man dressed up in an extravagant,
      layered dress, with large-sized breasts and exaggerated posterior, and carrying
      an oversized purse. She parades in the streets with an open parasol, stopping
      at the “colmados” or bodegas begging for his chicks–the town’s young people–who
      follow along behind him in the parade.
